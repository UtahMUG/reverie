title: Standardized Naming for Common TDM Files

At yesterday's monthly Interagency Modeling Technical Committee, we discussed the standardization of common TDM filenames across all the models in the state. This is facilitate better tracking of files as they are shared between agencies or users as they manage multiple models or model versions simultaneously.

For data associated with a specific model version (TAZ shapefiles, master networks, and assigned networks), the filename is comprised of three elements with a status optional: Data Type + Model Version + Date Modified (+ Dataset Status). For the Wasatch Front TDM shapfile, an example name would be TAZ_WFv9_20230721_Final.shp

For data not associated with a specific model version (segment shapfile), the filename has three elements: Data Type + Location Identifier + Modified Date (+ Dataset Status). An example would be the segment shapefile for Dixie: Segments_DX_20230901.shp.

Please feel free to share any comments or suggestions you may have.
