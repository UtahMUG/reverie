# Notes

- Model Status & RTP
   - Overall
      - TAZ splits and SE updates to every model
      - All models now have the capability to evaluate telecommute, e-Commerce, and Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV)
      - Cache MPO and Dixie MPO models moved to Cube v.6.4.5
      - All long range plans and models should be out by summer
   - MAG/WFRC
      - Beta v9 ran in Dec for AQ conformity
      - Recalibrating mode choice
         - Commuter Rail ridership low in some counties and higher than others compared to existing ridership
         - Recalibration should be done within a week
      - Models are available on GitHub
      - Discussion about population growth and output VMT growth rates in the model, model purpose, and the relationship to overall transportation/land use policy
   - Cache MPO
      - Some calibration done to the free-flow speeds with Wejo data
      - Ongoing Cache Co TMP update will be incorporated into the model
         - 1st evaluation of RTP projects underway
   - Dixie MPO
      - Updating model to run on Cube v6.4.5
   - Summit/Wasatch, Iron, USTM
      - Models complete, being used for UDOT LRP development
   - Summit/Wasatch: transit and recreational trips being worked on
- Steering Committee
   - Bill Hereth (WFRC) discussed purpose of committee
      - One major focus is aiding Natalia Brown and Bill Hereth (currently running the Utah MUG).
   - Looking for volunteers. Reach out to Natalia if interested
      - Ideally would have representation from academia, public, private, users, developers, etc
   - Greg MacFarlane (BYU) volunteered
- Bike Model Update: Presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PHHGpdHDdVFs-_dzkiubjPtGfW5t1pQraRcWFFGbEE0/edit). 
   - Base code and other data from various agencies
   - Discussed model inputs and structure
   - Discussed model outputs
   - In early stages of testing scenarios
   - Calibration process has improved model
   - Next steps:
      - Integrate 2023 HH Travel Survey
      - Update microzone creation
      - Trip gen sensitivity
   - Contact WFRC to share ideas
   - Questions about concerns of Streetlight data accuracy used for calibration
   - Questions about future integration in MAG/WFRC model
   - Access the bike model [here](https://github.com/WFRCAnalytics/utah_bike_demand_model).
