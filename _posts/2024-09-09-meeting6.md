## Presentations

* **Visualizing WF TDM Outputs via the New vizTool ([link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZrE6csbAJ6p5UFqkcafWv9Qa-vOIcZ-mv0npilMEW7E/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"})**<br/>*Bill Hereth ‚Äì Data Scientist, Wasatch Front Regional Council*<br/>*Summary:* The upcoming v9.1 release of the Wasatch Front Travel Demand Model will feature a new visualization tool, vizTool, designed to enhance the way users interact with and analyze model outputs. This tool simplifies the process of exploring complex data sets by providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing users to easily interpret and present key insights from scenario runs. The vizTool offers dynamic, accessible visualizations tailored to travel demand model users. We will solicit feedback from those present at the meeting to see how we can best support users to make this a successful tool.

* **Half Time Break**<br>*Ivan Hooper, Avenue Consultants*

* **Illustrating the use of Activity-based models in Utah ([link](https://byu.box.com/s/v2ii2lweuq2ykvnucmzp4e925ydvewnu){:target="_blank"})**<br/>*Greg Macfarlane ‚Äì Assistant Professor, Brigham Young University*<br/>*Tim Baird ‚Äì Associate, Fehr & Peers*<br/>*Hayden Atchley ‚Äì Travel Demand Modeler, Utah Department of Transportation*<br/>*Summary:* In the past 20 years, many MPO‚Äôs in the United States have moved to an activity-based model for their transportation planning efforts, and lessons learned from this transition have affected the decisions of other agencies for almost that time period. A recent UDOT and WFRC- funded research project examined attitudes towards activity-based models from current practitioners, and illustrated how scenario analysis works in both models. The results of the research suggest that modern activity-based models might not be as difficult to configure and use as commonly believed.

 - Why the VizTool
    - Nearly instantaneous visualization of outputs
    - Broad range of data
 - What‚Äôs it made of
    - ArcGIS javascript ACI, calcite, chart.js
    - Data is stored in text files called JSON
    - Jacascript classes that make it scalable as more data and functionality is added
    - Self contained and transferable
 - Where is the VizTool going from here?
    - BETA will be released with TDM v9.1
    - Updates will be flexible and not always tied to the newest TDM release
    - Intent is to extend to other models (TDMs in the state, bikeway models, etc)
 - Best way to learn and be supported on the VizTool
    - GitHub repository with issues and wiki documentation
    - One on one training

    - Maybe a couple of months after the release
 - Have to make sure that all of your links that you want to show up need to have a SEGID otherwise it‚Äôs not going to show up in VizTool
 - Network Comparisons
    - Scenario Selector
    - Functions as a ‚Äúthis scenario‚Äù minus ‚Äúthis scenario.‚Äù
    - Once you collapse the ‚ÄúCompare To‚Äù it stops the comparison
    - It‚Äôs easy to misinterpret data, so make sure you know the network and the why well.
    - Truck percentages not currently included
 - Last slide appears to say which variables are currently included and what is planned

**[Illustrating the use of Activity-based models in Utah](https://byu.app.box.com/s/v2ii2lweuq2ykvnucmzp4e925ydvewnu){:target="_blank"}** *Greg Macfarlane*
 - Project got finished yesterday, should be published soon
 - Trip vs Activity Based Models
    - Set of choices differ
    - Trying to get to the same point, but how they get there is going to vary. Example is people going to work before lunch vs people who go straight from home to a restaurant
 - Practitioner Survey
    - When and why did your agency transition to an activy based model
    - What did development and adoption look like?
    - Benefits
        - Peak spreading, pricing, demographic change, equity analysis
    - Drawbacks
        - Longer run times, few benefits for basic highway capacity analysis, more complex scenario analysis, small consultant pool, model sensitivity vs random elements
 - Comparative Illustration
    -  WFRC TDM used the ActivitySim as part of the Highway Skims section
    -  Opens up a lot of choice
    -  ActivitySim not a new concept, but it‚Äôs a good methodology to follow
    -  Focusing on tours rather than single trips
    -  Breaking down the different trips based on the mode
    -  Non-home based trips are very hard to explain in a trip-based model
    -  Mode switching from scenario to scenario
        - Driving alone, carpooling (2), carpooling (3+)
        - You can see what modes people use throughout the tour where in the trip-based model you can‚Äôt
        - When you double the commuter rail in a day, how many people are switching and where?
 - Remote Work Considerations
    - Rebound effect
        - Fewer work trips may cause more non-work trips
    - Trip Length
        - Longer commute more likely to work remotely
    - Household structure
        - Single vs dual parent
        - Age of children
 - Conclusions
    - Cited difficulties
        - Computational complexity
            - Similar runtime on same hardware
        - Complicated design
            - Easier interpretation with activity based
        - Lack of interoperability
            - ActivitySim remote work sub-models taken from SEMCOG
            - Simple to add/edit parameters
        - Staff Training
            - Similar time/effort between models
