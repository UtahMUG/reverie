        <strong>Education:</strong> MS City & Metropolitan Planning - University of Utah <br><br/>
		
		<strong>Current Employment:</strong> Transportation Planner at Metro Analytics <br><br/>
		
        <strong>Greatest Interests about Travel Demand Modeling and Forecasting:</strong> Integration of various data sources and its implementation supporting safety, equity and resiliency assessments <br><br/>

        <strong>Favorite Modeling Project(s):</strong> We worked with UTA and WFRC to utilize the WF-TDM to understand the potential societal benefits and economic impacts of different transit investment strategies. We did this by modeling transit expansion, transit intensification, and congestion relief (specifically targeting the areas with the highest congestion).  <br><br/>

        <strong>Valuable Resources, Tools or Software:</strong> The built-in scripts of the WF-TDM have been very helpful while creating custom scripts to run over the TDM outputs to extract summaries in the format I need.   <br><br/>

        <strong>Hobbies and Interests:</strong>  I explore various topics in data science, including integrating big data into transportation planning, automating boring tasks, and recently I have been trying to learn how to set up and run open-source LLM models locally in my PC, so that I can protect the privacy of the prompts I use. <br><br/>
