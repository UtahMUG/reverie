At yesterday's monthly Interagency Modeling Technical Committee (IMTC) meeting, we discussed the process for maintaining and updated the segment shapefile.

MPOs and UDOT use planning segments based on road centerline features to process and visualize volume data from travel demand models. These planning segments are stored in a segment shapefile. Each planning entity is responsible for the management and maintenance of the planning segments for their respective planning area. UDOT is responsible for updating the statewide Master Segment shapefile consisting of the latest edits made in the subarea segments.

More details on these points and the technical procedure can be found in this google doc: [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eLN3vicf9w7GPfW-oszdKlCwD4AFZlE4gRsdfx2NUnA/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}.

Please feel free to share any comments or suggestions you may have.
