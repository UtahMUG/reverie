        <strong>Education:</strong> BS in Civil Engineering from Brigham Young University <br><br/>

        <strong>Greatest Interests about Travel Demand Modeling and Forecasting:</strong> The ability to forecast the future. <br><br/>

        <strong>Favorite Modeling Project(s):</strong> I spent about seven years or more working on West Davis Corridor EIS.  That's the project I really learned how to use the WFRC/MAG Travel Demand Model. <br><br/>

        <strong>Valuable Resources, Tools or Software:</strong> I find WinMerge very useful to compare text files. <br><br/>

        <strong>Hobbies and Interests:</strong> Some things I like include going out with my wife, backpacking, hiking, fishing, mountain biking, and playing chess. <br><br/> 

        <strong>What Else?</strong> During the West Davis Corridor EIS, UDOT hired Matt Riffkin with Interplan (one of our competing firms) to quality-check our work with the TDM.  Those meetings were painful because Matt did not hold back and ripped up everything we did and every assumption we made with the model.  It forced us to be very solid in our modeling and ultimately provided UDOT with a very defensible EIS document.  I grew to appreciate honest and good feedback. <br><br/>
