        <strong>Education:</strong> Arizona State University, BS, MS Urban Planning and GIS <br><br/>

        <strong>Greatest Interests about Travel Demand Modeling and Forecasting:</strong> The fact that it provides planners like me with the most accurate method of seeing the future. Without it, we might still be looking at crystal balls to make our planning decisions. <br><br/>

        <strong>Favorite Modeling Project(s):</strong> Favorite? Probably not, but the most important: Northern Corridor Expressway in Washington County. This roadway project has had more analysis hours in modeling than I have working hours in my professional career. <br><br/>

        <strong>Valuable Resources, Tools or Software:</strong> I was never formally trained on how to use a Travel Demand Model, but my education in GIS software such as ESRI products made all the difference in understanding the data that gets input into the model.  <br><br/>

        <strong>Hobbies and Interests:</strong> Skateboarding - Not Tony Hawk, but have a love for it, and itâ€™s my preferred method of transportation. Teaching my daughter to skateboard. <br><br/>
