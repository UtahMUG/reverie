Come learn about the newest iteration of the Utah Household Travel Survey conducted in 2023. On April 23, WFRC is hosting an in-person lunch meeting (with virtual option) for members of Utah Data Engineers and Scientists in Transportation (uDEST) and any other interested parties.

We will focus not on the results, but on accessing and querying the data itself. Hurray for uDEST!!!

If you would like to attend, RSVP to info@udest.org.

In this meeting, we will discuss the following: 

- Introduction to the survey scope and contents
- Demo of the interactive R-Shiny web application to do ad hoc queries using a GUI interface 
- Deep dive into accessing the data in Google BigQuery and querying via SQL (restricted access to agencies only)
- Discussion of resources to further explore the data (including obtaining access, data dictionary, etc)

# ABOUT THE SURVEY

The 2023 Utah Moves Transportation Survey was a statewide household travel survey (HTS) conducted in the Spring of 2023. The goal of the project was to collect day-to-day travel information from residents in the state to support travel demand modeling and other planning initiatives.

## WHAT WAS THE GOAL OF THE 2023 UTAH MOVES TRANSPORTATION SURVEY?

Our goal was to get a complete picture of regional transportation patterns to better plan for future improvements. The survey helps us understand how local roads, highways, public transportation, bike lanes, and sidewalks are used today, and how they can be improved to make travel better in the future.

## HOW WERE PARTICIPANTS SELECTED?

Invited households were selected at random from across Utah. Additional participants were also recruited via universities in Utah to help plan for university specific travel.

## WHO ADMINISTERED THE SURVEY?

This survey was administered by Resource Systems Group (RSG).

## WHO SPONSORED THE SURVEY?

This survey was sponsored by the:

- Utah Department of Transportation
- Utah Transit Authority
- Cache Metropolitan Planning Organization
- Dixie Metropolitan Planning Organization
- Mountainland Association of Governments
- Wasatch Front Regional Council
