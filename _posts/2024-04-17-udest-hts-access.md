title: 2023 Utah Household Travel Survey--Accessing Data and Insights
author: Bill Hereth
---

Come learn about the newest iteration of the Utah Household Travel Survey conducted in 2023. On April 23, WFRC is hosting an in-person lunch meeting (with virtual option) for members of Utah Data Engineers and Scientists in Transportation (uDEST) and any other interested parties.

We will focus not on the results, but on accessing and querying the data itself. Hurray for uDEST!!!

If you would like to attend, RSVP to info@udest.org.

In this meeting, we will discuss the following: 

- Introduction to the survey scope and contents
- Demo of the interactive R-Shiny web application to do ad hoc queries using a GUI interface 
- Deep dive into accessing the data in Google BigQuery and querying via SQL (restricted access to agencies only)
- Discussion of resources to further explore the data (including obtaining access, data dictionary, etc)
